GRADE SHEET FOR CS134 LAB 8 ("Ciphers"):

Task 1:  rotateLetter
    + passes all instructor doctests
    + does not use .index or create an alphabet string
    ~ does not use an unnecessary else return statement
    + has a default return type of string

Task 2: Message Class
    + __slots__ completed
    + __init__ works as expected
    + text property correctly implemented
    + wordCount property correctly implemented
    + wordCount uses appropriate helper function
    + rotate method correctly implemented
    + rotate method uses rotateLetter helper function
    + rotate and wordCount use text property
    + added a new doctest to each method in this class

Task 3: Plaintext Class
    + __init__ initializes uninherited attributes
    + shift property correctly implemented
    ~ shift setter correctly implemented
    + encrypt correctly implemented
    + encrypt uses appropriate helper function
    + added a new doctest to each method in this class

Task 4: Ciphertext Class
    + __init__ initializes inherited attributes correctly
    ~ decrypt method correctly implemented
    + decrypt uses appropriate helper methods
    ~ bestDecryption implemented correctly
    + bestDecryption does not use unnecessary loops or lists
    + bestDecryption returns a plaintext object
    + added a new doctest to each method in this class

Task 5: decrypt.py
    + Running file as a script correctly decrypts story
    + File decoded.txt contains the decrypted story


Grade: A-


Comments from Graders: Generally well done.
* cipherTools.rotateLetter
  - you should be using ord()/chr() rather than hardcoding ASCII numbers
* Plaintext
  * shift.setter
    ~ shiftValue should always be between 0-25 (use %26 to ensure that, see inline
      comment)
* Ciphertext
  * decrypt
    - when creating the Plaintext object you need to pass in unshift; your code
      would fail the following:
        >>> cipher = Ciphertext('jgnnq').decrypt(2).encrypt
        'jgnnq'
