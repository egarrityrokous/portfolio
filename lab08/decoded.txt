Rumor says that when President Zephaniah Swift Moore, second president of Williams College, decamped from Williamstown in 1821 to become the first president of Amherst College, he took with him not only fifteen students, but a number of books from the Williams College library. One-hundred seventy-three years later, Williams fourteenth-president told an audience at Amherst that he calculated that, "at reasonable compound rates" Amherst owed Williams "at least a million volumes." Shortly thereafter the Williams College Mucho Macho Moo-cow Marching Band presented the Amherst marching band with a bill for 1.6 billion dollars in library fines for overdue books.
