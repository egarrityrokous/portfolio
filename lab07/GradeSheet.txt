GRADE SHEET FOR CS134 LAB 7 ("Fun with Recursion"):

    Warm-up Task: sumDigits
          + passes all instructor doctests
          + has an explicit base case and correctly handles it
          + correctly handles recursive call
          + the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          + int not converted to str
          + clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 1: bedtimeStory
          + passes all instructor doctests
          + correct calls to firstSentence and lastSentence
          + has an explicit base case
          + the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          + clean and interpretable code with comments
          + one additional doctest is provided
    Task 2: quilt
          + drawQuilt-500-4.ps found and matches specs
          + testDrawQuilt(500, 4) actually generates figure
          + drawQuilt calls drawSquare once
          + drawQuilt uses only the allowed turtle commands
          + drawQuilt uses color1, color2 rather than GOLD, PURPLE
          + the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          + has an explicit base case
          + clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 3: shrub
          + shrub-100-15-0.8-10.ps found and matches specs
          + testShrub(100, 15, 0.8, 10) actually generates figure
          + testShrub(100, 15, 0.8, 10) prints (232, 3973.9861913600025)
          + shrub uses only the allowed turtle commands
          + the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          + has an explicit base case
          + clean and interpretable code with comments
    Extra credit: recursiveSquares
          + produces correct output (figure and text)
          + recursiveSqCount uses only the allowed turtle commands
          + the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          + has an explicit base case
          + clean and interpretable code with comments


Grade: A+

Comments from Graders:
Good job throughout.  Nice job on the extra credit!

To improve readability, you want to put horizontal whitespace around commas
commas consistently.  (Space helps around operators too.)

See other suggestions for improvement in code such as improving readability
by inserting blank lines between logical blocks of code.

You also want to choose descriptive variable names that indicate which
case they correspond to.  Please see comments in code.
