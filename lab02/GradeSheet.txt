Comments from Graders:
Good job!  In the dayOfWeek() function, you need to always return
a value, regardless of what the user enters.  That means you need an "else"
block in your function, either turning the elif for Saturday into an "else"
block or creating a separate "else" block where you return some default
default value, that could be any day of the week that you choose.  Please
see style comments in day.py.
