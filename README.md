# My Portfolio
Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Eamon Garrity-Rokous, and I'm currently a sophomore at Williams College on the varsity wrestling team planning on double-majoring in Computer Science and Economics (B.A.). This is a repository of my lab coding projects from computer science courses taken at Phillips Academy Andover and Williams College. Some of these lab projects may include instructors' feedback and files they initially provided to students to begin their work, in addition to my own comments. A PDF of my resume is also included in this repository, or you can find here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3c1s2ngsKhbpgj2f-2KBnzyawNK67eN/view?usp=sharing
