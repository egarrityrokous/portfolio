Thanks for visiting my Github page! My name is Eamon Garrity-Rokous, and I’m currently a sophomore at Williams College on the varsity wrestling team planning on double-majoring in Computer Science and Economics (B.A.). On this page is a portfolio repository of my coding projects from computer science courses taken at Phillips Academy Andover and Williams College. Some of these lab projects may include instructors’ feedback and files they initially provided to students to begin their work, in addition to my own comments. A PDF of my resume is included in this repository, or you can it find here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p2Mq08t6Na7lld_DhKDGGtqZNjVPquqS?usp=sharing

A little about me: I love investing in and building ideas, businesses, and their development and growth/scaling strategies. I also love business operations, product management, coding, creating, and all things innovative and revolutionary. I’m involved in startups, Venture Capital, FinTech, EdTech, and Web3. I have assorted efficiencies in Python, Java, Scala, Apache Spark, PostGreSQL, SQL, R, Databricks, AI, ML, Reinforcement Learning, Excel, and PowerPoint. I’m looking to collaborate with passionate people in the startup, VC, and business world and on projects we are excited about working on every early morning we wake up.
