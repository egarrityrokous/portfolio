# projects
A repository of Eamon Garrity-Rokous's coding projects for fun and from computer science courses taken at Phillips Academy Andover and Williams College.
Be sure to open up the Interactive Solar System Model project in a sketchbook like Processing and the Wu-Tang Forever project in Google Colaboratory for the
full experience of both projects!
