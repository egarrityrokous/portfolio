# Coding Projects
A repository of Eamon Garrity-Rokous's programming lab projects from computer science courses taken at Phillips Academy Andover and Williams College. Some of these lab projects may include instructors' feedback and files they initially provided to students to begin their work, in addition to my own comments. A PDF of my resume is also included in this repository. I love coding, creating, and all things entrepreneurial in spirit. Thanks for visiting my site; be sure to come back for project updates!
