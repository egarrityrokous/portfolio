# Coding Projects
A repository of Eamon Garrity-Rokous's coding projects from computer science courses taken at Phillips Academy Andover and Williams College. A PDF of my resume is also included in this repository. I love coding, creating, and all things entrepreneurial in spirit. Thanks for visiting my site; be sure to come back for project updates!
